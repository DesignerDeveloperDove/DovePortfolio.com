                <strong>navigateing</strong> to the nearest hospital that takes your insurance so that you can get the <strong>aid</strong> you need.
                It does this by first taking your general information such as ,Name, Email , D.O.B, Social Security Number, and Insurance provider,
                and finding the nearest facility that takes your insurance. The app should be used by those who have need of a medical assistance of any kind including 
                but not limited to hospitals. It also searches for <strong>Dentist, O.B.G.Y.N, Pulmonogist, Dermotologist, </strong> and so much more!

            <H3 style="float: left; color: white; padding-left: 10%; font-size: 40px;">Discovery:</H3><p style="font-size: 23px; padding-left: 4%;">This topic is actually very near and dear to my heat, i discovered this was a problem from personal experience
                i had health problems as a child and i remember being in emergency situations and my parents driving across the world just to find someone that could take 
                our insurance. They had no idea who took their insurance because we had just moved to georgia, we had no dentist, no pediatrican, not even a family doctor.
                so when i got older and found out that most people find these services through "Referral", i felt like there has to be an easier way to find aid besides "trust me bro".
            </p>
            <H3 style="float: left; color: white; padding-left: 10%; font-size: 30px;">Interviews:</H3><p style="font-size: 23px; padding-left: 4%;">At this point i began to wonder 
            who else had this same problem and was this worth my time or am i just a child? i made a few mockups and asked a few questions, here are some of my questions.</p>
                <img style="width: 80%;margin-left: 10%;" src="Navicaid Interview questions.png">

                <H3 style="float: left; color: white; padding-left: 10%; font-size: 40px;">Definition:</H3><p style="font-size: 23px; padding-left: 4%;">When defining this problem i first began by removing any bias i have towards the topic.
                I recieved a few interview responses that made me change how i define the apps purpose, one of my "users" is a nurse student and she has an issue because shes only allowed
                to use her insurance on campus grounds. Other users were pregnant and wondered if the app would save information or would it be like apple maps where you have to type in the same address everyday until it knows u go often
                These type of questions led me to change the problem definition from "User cant find service" to "user wants a <strong>convienent</strong> way to find service", making my problem
                    <EM><STRONG>How can i make finding a service that takes your provider 1.quick 2. convienent.</STRONG></EM>
                </p>
                <H3 style="float: left; color: white; padding-left: 10%; font-size: 40px;">Development:</H3><p style="font-size: 23px; padding-left: 4%;">
                For the development of this app i wanted to keep the user flow fast as to stay on track with my problem. this was my "low-fi" user flow.

                <p style="font-size: 40px; width: 90%; color: black;">As you can see its not perfect but it is as short as it can be to keep the user on one main path.</p>

                    to learn "react" and take this design into a real app. Overall  Navicaid has a long way to go, however i hope youll stay along for the ride!</p>
